# Mainframe File Processing Project

This repository contains a COBOL program that reads data from an input file, processes it, and writes the output to another file.

## Files
- `FILEPROC.CBL`: The main COBOL program for file processing.
- `input.dat`: Sample input file with data to be processed.
- `output.dat`: Output file where processed data will be written.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have access to a mainframe environment with a COBOL compiler.
2. Place `input.dat` in the appropriate directory as per your environment settings.
3. Compile the `FILEPROC.CBL` program.
4. Execute the compiled program to process the data.
5. Check `output.dat` for the processed results.

## Sample Input and Output
**input.dat:**
